Abstract. The last decade has seen an increased interest in the study of networks in many fields of science.
Examples are numerous, from sociology to biology, and to physical systems such as power grids.
Nonetheless, the field of service networks has received less attention. Previous research has
mainly tackled the modeling of single service systems and service compositions, often focusing
only on studying temporal relationships between services. The objective of this paper is to propose
a computational model to represent the various types of relationships which can be established
between services systems to model service networks. This work acquires a particular importance
since the study of service networks can bring new scientific discoveries on how service-based
economies operate at a global scale.
