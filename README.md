Abstract. The last decade has seen an increased interest in the study of networks in many fields of science.
Examples are numerous, from sociology to biology, and to physical systems such as power grids.
Nonetheless, the field of service networks has received less attention. Previous research has
mainly tackled the modeling of single service systems and service compositions, often focusing
only on studying temporal relationships between services. The objective of this paper is to propose
a computational model to represent the various types of relationships which can be established
between services systems to model service networks. This work acquires a particular importance
since the study of service networks can bring new scientific discoveries on how service-based
economies operate at a global scale.

Linked Service Systems for USDL (LSS-USDL) is an ontology for modeling service systems in RDF. This brings many advantages to organizations that make use of this ontology:

 - The resulting service models may be used as documentation for the service operations or to generate service descriptions for various stakeholders
 - A freely available and complete service description presents a solid evidence of an organization's effort towards transparency
 - After modeling a complete service system it is possible to identify previously unknown bottlenecks and fail points and to study how to overcome them
 - After all operations of a service system are identified it is possible to execute automation tasks that can greatly reduce costs
 - It is also possible to run simulations based on the service model, which aid managerial and operational decisions
 - Because this ontology uses Semantic Web tools and integrates with the Linked Data Cloud, a strong data integration is also ensured
 - Service models may create custom service descriptions aimed at customers that could be used in a generic online services marketplace

## Model Explanation

### 6-Point Interaction Star

A service system can be expressed as the flow of its interactions. Service interactions take place when any actor interacts with the service system. We use the journalism interrogative pronouns (who, how, why, where, when, what) to give a better context to service interactions.
