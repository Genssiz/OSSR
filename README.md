Open Semantic Service Relationship Model

The last decade has seen an increased interest in the study of networks in many fields of science. Examples are numerous, from sociology to biology, and to physical systems such as power grids. Nonetheless, the field of service networks has received less attention. Previous research has mainly tackled the modeling of single service systems and service compositions, often focusing only on studying temporal relationships between services. The objective of this paper is to propose a computational model to represent the various types of relationships which can be established between services systems to model service networks. This work acquires a particular importance since the study of service networks can bring new scientific discoveries on how service-based economies operate at a global scale.
